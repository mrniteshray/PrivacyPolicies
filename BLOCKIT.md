## ⚙️ 2. Permissions We Use and Why

To offer core features that help users stay focused, Blockit requests the following permissions:

- **Accessibility Service:**  
  Required to detect and block specific UI components like Shorts/Reels from apps (e.g., YouTube, Instagram).  
  📌 *We use this only to help block distractions. No data is read, stored, or shared.*

- **Usage Access:**  
  Required to identify which apps are running so they can be blocked if needed.

- **Battery Optimization Exemption:**  
  Required to allow Blockit to run uninterrupted in the background for real-time blocking.

- **Notification Permission:**  
  Used to display helpful reminders when blocking starts, ends, or focus mode is active.

- **Website Blocking (via in-app browser/WebView):**  
  Websites are blocked using local filters. We do **not collect, store, or transmit** any URLs or browsing data.

## 👁️‍🗨️ Accessibility Service Disclosure (Google Play Compliance)

Blockit requests the Accessibility Service permission **only** for the following core features:

- Detecting which apps and screens are currently active to block distracting content (such as
  Shorts, Reels, or other specified apps).
- Automatically displaying a block overlay to help you stay focused.

**What accessibility data Blockit receives:**

- Limited information about which app or UI screen is in use (the app package name, some
  non-personal accessibility events such as window/state changes).

**What Blockit does NOT access or collect:**

- The app does **not** read, log, store, or transmit:
    - Text contents displayed on your device
    - Personal information, messages, passwords, payment details
    - Input fields, audio, or touch input

All accessibility events are processed entirely **on your device** and are **never collected,
uploaded, sold, or shared with anyone**.

Granting Accessibility permission is **completely optional**, but some focus & blocking features
will not work without it. You can continue to use other features without granting this permission.

**How to revoke:**

- At any time, you can disable Accessibility permission for Blockit in your device's Android
  Settings under: `Settings` > `Accessibility` > `Installed Services` > `Blockit` > Disable.

Blockit strictly follows the Google Play User Data Policy for Accessibility and user privacy.
